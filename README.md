# mall-navigator

Every mallâ€™s layout is different. Given the mall sizes, nowadays it is difficult to navigate from one location inside the mall to another. Hence, malls usually provide maps. Rather than maps, some malls do offer apps for navigation. This program navigates from one location on a 2D mall map to another.

Details:
- The map must be input from a text file.
- The format of the file must follow the provided template.
- There is always a path between two given locations on the map, i.e. there are no isolated locations.
- The start and end locations are randomly picked by the program.
